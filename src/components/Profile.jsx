        Programmer, a professional with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and
        Physics, possessing academic knowledge and programming skills with a
        focus on mobile applications, creative thinking, and an emphasis on
        solving complex problems through teamwork and project-oriented
        approaches. I am self-disciplined and committed to acquiring new
        knowledge and achieving personal and professional goals. One of my most
        significant achievements was participating in the Misi√≥n Tic 2021
        program. During this program, I collaborated with my peers to develop a
        web page similar to Instagram using Python and Flask. Additionally, I
        contributed to the development of a mobile application capable of
        managing groups, students, and classes using Flutter (Dart) and
        Firebase.
